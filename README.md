# Buzz! Timer
Buzz! is a timer for the Pomdoro technique.  It times "work" period of 25 minute intervals with "rest" periods of 5 minute intervals.  The watch buzzes to tell you when the intervals change.  The dots on the screen show how many work periods you've completed!

Made during the Fall 2015 HackNY Hackathon!
